        <p>The success of Bitcoin, the world’s first distributed cryptocurrency, has shed light on its
        shortcomings. One of these shortcomings is the low throughput of 3 to 7 transactions
        per second. To make Bitcoin a feasible candidate for a global payment network, these
        numbers have to increase dramatically.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, solutions have been proposed that run on top of Bitcoin, in a sort of
        second layer. The majority of transactions now occurring in the Bitcoin blockchain could
        theoretically be offloaded into this second layer, thereby improving the throughput to
        levels that rival current centralized global payment networks like VISA. The Lightning
        Network has emerged as the first real contender of being such a network.</p>
        <p>These networks have the additional property of improving the anonymity and privacy of
        the participants. Privacy and anonymity on the level of the native Bitcoin blockchain,
        the first layer, so to speak, is a well-studied subject. But this body of knowledge is still
        lacking when it comes to the Payment Channel Networks proposed for the second layer.
        The goal of this study is to formally analyze privacy in the context of second layer payment
        channel networks that run on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain.</p>
        <p>The results should provide more transparency in the use of cryptocurrencies in transactions done on a Payment Channel Networks. It seeks to increase the awareness of the
        risks involved in dealing with cryptocurrencies. Lastly, the techniques developed in this
        research should be beneficial in due-diligence of reporting institutions by scrutinizing and
        screening blockchain and PCN transactions.</p>
